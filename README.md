# React Todo List

A simple React-based Todo List application demonstrating basic functionality such as adding, toggling, and deleting tasks. This project showcases core React concepts like state management, event handling, and component-based architecture.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Enter a new task and click the **Add** button to include it in the list.
- **Mark tasks as completed**: Click on any task to toggle its completion status.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove a task from the list by clicking the **Delete** button.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- A package manager such as **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm**.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/<YourRepoName>.git

	2.	Navigate into the project directory:

cd <YourRepoName>


	3.	Install dependencies (example using npm):

npm install

Or using yarn:

yarn



Running in Development Mode

If you’re using Vite:

npm run dev

Then visit http://localhost:5173.

If you’re using Create React App:

npm start

Then visit http://localhost:3000.

Building for Production

To create an optimized build:

npm run build

	•	For Vite, the production-ready files will appear in the dist folder.
	•	For Create React App, they will appear in the build folder.

You can then deploy these static files to any web server or hosting platform.

Deploying

Popular ways to deploy a React project include:
	•	GitHub Pages
	•	Netlify
	•	Vercel
	•	Any static hosting service (e.g., AWS S3, Firebase Hosting)

Refer to each service’s documentation for detailed deployment steps.

Folder Structure

Below is a typical structure (it may vary depending on whether you used Vite or Create React App):

my-todo-app
├─ public/          # Static assets or HTML template
├─ src/
│  ├─ App.js        # Main App component
│  ├─ index.js      # Entry point
│  └─ ...           # Other components / utilities
├─ package.json
├─ vite.config.js   # (Vite projects only)
├─ yarn.lock / package-lock.json
└─ README.md
